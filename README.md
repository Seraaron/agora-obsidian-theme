##### Special Feature (tag-styling)

Use any of the following tags to add some special symbols to your document

- `#quote` Big quotation mark, for block quotes
- `#important` A big  exclamation point shaped bullet
- `#question` A question mark shaped bullet
- `#asterisk` A big asterisk shaped bullet

_**Note:**_ This will not look good if you already make use of any of the above tags for any other reason, including in metadata. You will need to manually edit and delete or comment out the ones that you don't want to use if they are causing you problems.
